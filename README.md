Introduction to Computing

Course Description
The objective of this course is to introduce students to the field of computing and problem solving with the help of an object-oriented programming language (C++). Hence the course will cover many C++ features in detail as needed so students will also be learning a structured programming language. Through the lectures, quizzes, take-home exams, and interactive recitations students will learn how to design algorithms based on object-oriented programming paradigms.

* CURRICULUM *
Week 1: Introduction to Programming Languages, Data Representation (bits and bytes), basic programming structure and concepts: identifiers, literals, symbols, variables, screen input/output (cin and cout)

Week 2: Basic data types (int/double/char/bool) and basic arithmetic operations with their precedence, first C++ program with Visual MS Studio

Week 3: Functions with/out return values, function prototypes, parameter passing (pass by value and by reference)

Week 4: Conditional statements (if-else), nested else-if statements, logical operators (&&, ||, !)

Week 5: String class, loops (while, for, do-while) 

Week 6: Loops (while, for, do-while), char data type

Week 7: File I/O, console stream cin, input and output file streams, string streams

Week 8: Midterm (Tentative, Lectures may resume)

Week 9: Structs, enum, vectors/arrays and vector operations: sequential/binary search, insert/delete to a vector

Week 10: Sorting (selection and insertion sort) and introduction to algorithm complexity analysis, vector of structs, matrix
